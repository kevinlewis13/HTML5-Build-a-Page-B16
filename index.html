              <h1>When you need mobility and performance for gaming</h1>
              <p>PC gamers that need the mobility of a laptop are faced with purchasing a separate gaming desktop for graphics performance and a laptop for small size, light weight, cool temperature, and long battery life. This solution is expensive and keeping the two machines in sync is not always easy. One alternative is to purchase an expensive gaming laptop and deal with lugging around a large and heavy machine, getting burned by the heat, and little battery life. And, when it comes time to upgrade, the only option is to replace the entire laptop.</p>
              <p>With a ViDock expansion chassis, you can simply unplug and go to take full advantage of your laptop’s mobile features - light weight, cool, small laptop with great battery life. When you get home, just plug in one cable and your are ready! No sync, no firing up a separate machine, no aches and pains of lugging a heavy computer around all day. And, when it’s time to upgrade, just replace the graphics card with the latest one available - in a few minutes!</p>

              <h1>Intelligent Power Management</h1>
              <p>ViDock 3 manages its own power, so there is no need to fiddle with an on/off button. The embedded microcontroller in ViDock 3 senses the laptop’s power state and keeps the graphics card in sync even while cycling through suspend or sleep modes.</p>
